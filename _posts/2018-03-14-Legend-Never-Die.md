What a sad day in human history. Stephen Hawking, the brightest star in the firmament of science, whose insights shaped modern cosmology and inspired global audiences in the millions, has died at age 76. 

I felt ashamed that I haven't finished his famous book, A Brief History of Time, even I've got it more than 10 years ago. In memory of what he inspired us, I want to list some of his quotes below. R.I.P, our beloved scientist. 

> One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.

> My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all.

> One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn't exist... Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.

> Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.

> Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. 

> I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die.

> It matters that you don't just give up.

> Nothing is better than reading and gaining more and more knowledge.

> One is always a long way from solving a problem until one actually has the answer.

> Thus, in a sense, we are all doomed. even if we stay away from black holes.
